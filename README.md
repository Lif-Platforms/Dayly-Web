# Dayly
Dayly is a new social media platform where you can only post every 24 hours. It hasn't launched yet but lets work together to make it a reality.

# About Dayly
Dayly is designed so users can post every 24 hours. This so users will really put some thought in to the quality of their post. Users will be able to use a Lif account to use the service. Lif accounts can be used to log into all Lif services. When users post, there is a 24 hour wait period before they can post again. After that period is up, a countdown is started. The longer you wait after the wait period, the less points you get once you post.
